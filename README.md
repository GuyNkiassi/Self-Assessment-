# Module 21 Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

Managing projects perhaps demand most of individuals come together to work in a group or in a team, which requires leadership as well as facilitating and overseeing group and team working, and managing conflict. In this final project we were out in group of 4 to explore a way to visualize data from start to finish. This includes deciding if the creation of a group or team is the best approach to the task in hand (it is not always!), setting up the team-working processes, supporting teams through the different stages of development, reviewing progress and evaluating team outputs. The main activity involves to tell a data story, based on a current situation with a team or group that can extract, transform, and load data. As we just learn about analytics, it appears it can be very good approach to complement the evaluation and feedback of core skills. To get insight in usefulness of our proposal, data is pulled via Kaggle, transformed in python or VS code , and loaded in SQL
 
After studying this course for 6 months, Iâ€™m able to:
-	recognise the production of data visualization
-	understand issues of a team working with data who has to get them up and running
-	identify the different stages of data visualization and how we as a team we can support each other
-	understand and identify team processes (inputs, throughputs and outputs) and the implication of collaboration. 
-	Measure, analyze, and visualizing voice data coming from collaborative aspect of things


The overview of our project was to see if we could determine the passengers that survived from the night the Titanic sank by way of machine learning.  We found this dataset on Kaggle that was part of a challenge for the public to compete in. We downloaded and used their training dataset file to create our machine learning model. The original training dataset had eight features and one target variable that we would use to manipulate our data. We will create dataframes using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook are cleaning up our data. We'll then be creating different models to see how accuracy changes betweeen them and see if we can find sizeable improvements between them.

I'm glad I got to work on this project as I learned valuable concept that can br transferable to other projetcs. I have depened my machine learning and my tableau knowledge. I can easly say that I have strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills, as well as applying concepts learned in this boot camp. looking foward to keep laerning new things and tacling new projects as they proesent themselves.
